This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). I've always wanted a sort of portfolio website,
but I've never had the time to make one. I plan to make it list most of my work along with additional videos. For example, I'd like to make a page listing all of my YouTube videos, and make it so when 
you click on one, it redirects you to another page which embeds said video, summarizes it, includes sources and additional resources.
