Nowadays it's not uncommon for computers to be running hundreds of processes at a time. By this fact two major concerns arize: security and resource management. On one hand each application should be mostly isolated one from another. You wouldn't want [Notion](#) to be spying on what your [Chrome](#) browser open tabs are. And on the other you might be running these applications on an old laptop which doesn't have enough RAM to handle all of them at once.

These are the problems virtual memory solves. And that's what this video explains. I recommend you first give it a watch and come back here afterwards to read my written explanation. Although note that I've made some very slight mistakes here and there in said video. Thankfully these were all clarified in a comment I made and pinned in the comments section of said video.
<br />
Just for good measure I'll correct them here as well, but feel free to skip this list and watch the video, or maybe simply get on with the first chapter of this document:
<br />
1. I misspelled the Level 4 Page Map Table as "PLM4" instead of PML4 throughout the video.
2. At [6:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ultz9m0n0GE&t=375s&pp=0gcJCTAAlc8ueATH) I wrote 412 by accident. The number should be 512.
3. I realized just now that my illustration of page sizes might have been confusing. Regular pages are of 4KB which is 4096 bytes. Not 4096KB (just to be crystal clear)
4. The table entries contain a bit called the "present" bit (the rightmost bit). It's called that because as long as it is 1 it means the page is in memory. As soon as it is 0 it means the page is on disk, and when it is on disk the bits used for the physical page index are used to locate the page on disk instead.

### What is memory?

Work in progres..

### Memory paging

### Memory tables

### Virtual address

### Identity mapping

### Translation look-aside buffer

### Why use all these tables?
